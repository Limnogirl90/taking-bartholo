"As an ecologist, my view on teaching stems from raw experiences in the middle of a hot Montana summer while helping undergraduates design studies, conduct field work to collect data, followed by analyzing the data, and finally, interpreting the results. One student I had mentored did not find statistically significant results from her data, and she became discouraged, and told me, with tears in her eyes, “I wish I was better.” I knew from that moment that my way of teaching needed to integrate compassion and encouragement into the formal discourses of theory and empirical data. Largely due to this experience and others that occurred in the field and classroom, I believe that the goal of teaching ecology should be two-fold: to challenge students to think critically about ecological theory and research, and to provide guidance so that students can leave my course with confidence that they can do ecology.

Ecology is as much a course founded on theory as it is on empirical studies. Thinking critically about and being able to discuss major theories, their conflicts, and remaining big questions in ecology is central for students who aspire to go into research, because these aspects form the figurative base of the knowledge food web. Doing ecology requires that knowledge, plus the pure grit and motivation to keep asking questions and carrying out experiments designed to answer those questions. Ecology also necessitates some elements of creativity and ‘thinking on your feet’, especially when experiments do not go as planned. My course will pose students with a spectrum of scenarios to assess their problem-solving skills, and I will provide them with feedback along the way, so that they can reflect, modify, and improve upon how they go about solving problems. Ecology is also very collaborative in nature, and so I will provide students with assessments and experimental design prompts to complete individually and in small groups.
	
By implementing the above teaching approach, my goal is for students to have a solid foundation in ecology as well as practical problem-solving skills that they can carry with them throughout their lives. Through a combination of lecture, discussions, and assessments that test students’ ability to recall theory taught in class as well as ask them to chart out how they would design a study to answer a question, I want students to leave the course feeling confident that they can pursue ecological research to tackle some of the serious global issues confronting us. Finally, ecology is also largely a discipline characterized by trial and error. Accordingly, my classroom celebrates failure as much as it does successes. I truly believe that it is in making mistakes, we are forced to go back to the drawing board, and in the process, we edify our understanding and recognize that dedication to solving even one small problem can make large strides in answering hard questions in ecology."
